A good filter tuning should be just strong enough to suppress the peaks in the gyro readouts. A filter too weak may have peaks leaked inside the loop, and a filter too strong, while making the gyro signal clean, may lower the maximum gains later which cause a \\"sloppy\\" and delayed feel.","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Motorised Tail and TTA":{"id":"Tuning/Motorised Tail and TTA","title":"Motorised Tail and TTA","description":"Page 1","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Rescue mode settings":{"id":"Tuning/Rescue mode settings","title":"Rescue mode settings","description":"","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tune Cyclic":{"id":"Tuning/Tune Cyclic","title":"Tune Cyclic","description":"Page 1","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tune Feedforward":{"id":"Tuning/Tune Feedforward","title":"Tune Feedforward","description":"Page 1","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tune the Tail":{"id":"Tuning/Tune the Tail","title":"Tune the Tail","description":"Page 1","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tuning description":{"id":"Tuning/Tuning description","title":"Tuning Guide for 0602 version controller (Gyro D)","description":"This guide assumes no super low frequency (< 60Hz) global LPF","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tutorial - Quickstart/Converting from RF1 to RF2":{"id":"Tutorial - Quickstart/Converting from RF1 to RF2","title":"Converting from RF1 to RF2","description":"It is really important that a Rotorflight 1 backup/dump file is not loaded to the Rotorflight 2 controller.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorial - Quickstart/Introduction":{"id":"Tutorial - Quickstart/Introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Rotorflight is a flight control software suite for single rotor RC helicopters.
